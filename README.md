🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Task 2)

### 📌 Description
An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the **Minimax Algorithm**. The AI plays optimally against a human player and ensures it never loses.

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- Game Theory
- Minimax Algorithm
- Recursive Decision Making
- Python Programming

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- (Optional) Tkinter for GUI

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
🎯 Objective
To demonstrate classic AI gameplay logic using decision trees and search-based algorithms in a turn-based environment.

🎬 Task 4: Movie Recommendation System
📌 Description
A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a user-input movie title. It uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert movie titles into numerical vectors and cosine similarity to identify related movies.

🧠 Concepts Used
Content-Based Filtering

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

Cosine Similarity

Text Preprocessing & NLP Fundamentals

pandas & scikit-learn

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

pandas

scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Movie_Recommend.ipynb
or open it in Google Colab.

Run all cells. Use:

python
Copy
Edit
search("Avatar")
to get top recommended results.

🎯 Objective
To showcase how machine learning and natural language processing can be used to build real-world recommendation engines like those used by Netflix or Amazon Prime.
