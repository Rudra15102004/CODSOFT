## 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (CodSoft AI Internship Task 2)

This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence internship at **CodSoft**.

---

## 📌 Description
An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Python using the **Minimax Algorithm**. The AI plays optimally against a human user and never loses.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Game Theory
- Minimax Algorithm
- Recursive Decision Making
- Python Programming

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Algorithms
- (Optional) Tkinter for GUI

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the script using:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py


🎯 Objective
To implement classic game AI logic using fundamental algorithms, helping reinforce concepts like decision trees and recursive backtracking in a fun and interactive way.

# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (CodSoft AI Internship Task 4)

This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence internship at **CodSoft**.

## 📌 Description
A **content-based recommendation system** that suggests similar movies based on the title provided by the user. It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to process movie titles and **cosine similarity** to find and rank similar results.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Content-Based Filtering
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Cosine Similarity
- Text Preprocessing
- NLP Basics

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
Open the notebook in Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Movie_Recommend.ipynb
Run all cells and search for similar movies:

python
Copy
Edit
search("Avatar")
📂 Dataset
The dataset includes cleaned movie titles and metadata used to compute similarity scores.

🎯 Objective
To demonstrate how simple machine learning and NLP techniques can be used to build a real-world movie recommendation engine.
